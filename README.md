An updated preprint is uploaded to this github page


The code uploaded includes the source code of the proposed methods, and a demo based on a simulated dataset in which you can compare the accuracy.
The uploaded version is older than the code in the accepted manuscript, but newer than the BioRxiv version. 
I will be working on an updated version with more careful demonstration shortly.

The uploaded version (after user adaptation) has been used in the following manuscript
